# Overview

**Product:** Gen-AI Compliance Suite (V1.0 Demo)

**Problem:** Financial institutions like Regions Bank face significant operational burdens and risks managing complex, ever-changing regulatory requirements. Manual processes for tasks like regulatory research, contract review, policy alignment, and gap identification are inefficient, costly, and prone to human error.

**Target Audience (Initial):** Compliance teams within Regions Bank (Analysts, SMEs, Managers).

**Value Proposition:** This software leverages Generative AI (specifically, models accessed via API like Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet) to automate and assist with critical compliance tasks. It aims to dramatically increase efficiency, improve accuracy, reduce manual effort, and provide better oversight, ultimately strengthening the bank's compliance posture and mitigating risk. This demo serves to showcase these capabilities fully.

# Risks and Mitigations

*   **Technical Challenges:**
    *   *Risk:* Integrating multiple AI features with consistent quality and managing complex prompts/context for Claude 3 Sonnet. Handling diverse document parsing reliably.
    *   *Mitigation:* Start with simpler features (Q&A, Summary) to establish patterns. Use robust parsing libraries. Leverage Cursor.ai effectively but review generated code rigorously. Implement strong error handling around AI API calls. Modular code structure.
*   **Figuring out the MVP that we can build upon:**
    *   *Risk:* Scope creep within the V1.0 Demo build, delaying a presentable version.
    *   *Mitigation:* Adhere strictly to the phased roadmap above. Phase 1 represents the core foundational "MVP" *within the demo context*. Focus on getting these foundational elements working robustly first before expanding to all features required for the full demo.
*   **Resource Constraints:**
    *   *Risk:* Single resource handling CEO and all DevOps responsibilities creates a bottleneck and key person dependency. Development speed relies heavily on AI tooling effectiveness.
    *   *Mitigation:* Maximize DevOps automation (Terraform, Cloud Build CI/CD). Rely heavily on GCP managed services. Maintain clear infrastructure documentation. Rigorously review AI-generated code to ensure quality despite accelerated pace. Acknowledge this constraint and prioritize ruthlessly based on the roadmap.
*   **AI Model Risk (Misinformation/Hallucination):**
    *   *Risk:* AI generating inaccurate or inappropriate content for compliance tasks. Over-reliance by users.
    *   *Mitigation:* **CRITICAL:** Implement and enforce the SME Validation Workflow (F11) for all relevant outputs. Clearly label all AI-generated content. Use focused prompts with good context retrieved from the managed document corpus. Use high-quality sample data. Educate demo audience on the "human-in-the-loop" necessity.
*   **Data Quality & Privacy (Demo Context):**
    *   *Risk:* Using inappropriate data in the demo; ensuring AI provider adheres to data privacy terms.
    *   *Mitigation:* Strictly use curated, non-sensitive sample data. Confirm and adhere to Anthropic's data usage policies (ensure demo data isn't used for training). Secure demo environment appropriately (NF1).
*   **External API Dependency:**
    *   *Risk:* Latency or downtime of the external AI API provider impacting the demo. Cost overruns.
    *   *Mitigation:* Implement reasonable timeouts and error handling. Have backup demo talking points if API is slow/down. Monitor API usage costs during development. Choose cost-effective models like Claude 3 Sonnet or GPT-4o.
